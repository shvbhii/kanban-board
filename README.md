## üìù Project Description

A clean, modern, and highly functional Kanban-style task management board, inspired by applications like Trello. This project was built to explore and implement one of the most essential UI patterns in modern web development: drag-and-drop. Users can create tasks, organize them into columns ("To Do," "In Progress," "Done"), and seamlessly move them around to reflect their workflow.

### About the #30DaysOfVibeCoding Challenge

This project is an entry in my personal 30-day coding challenge. After encountering a major dependency issue with an older library, this project also became an exercise in adaptability, pivoting to a modern, actively maintained toolkit (`@dnd-kit`) to achieve the desired functionality.

## üåü Key Features

-   **Modern Drag-and-Drop:** Built with `@dnd-kit` for a smooth, accessible, and high-performance drag-and-drop experience.
-   **Persistent State:** Your board is automatically saved to your browser's `localStorage`. Refresh the page, and your tasks will be exactly where you left them.
-   **Dynamic Task Management:** Easily add new tasks to the "To Do" column and delete any task with a single click.
-   **Multi-Column Workflow:** Organize tasks across different stages of completion.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** The app is cleanly structured into reusable components like `<Column>`, `<TaskCard>`, and `<Footer>`.
-   **Visually Appealing UI:** A sleek, dark-mode theme designed for clarity and focus.

## üíª Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React.js, Vite
-   **Drag & Drop:** `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`
-   **Styling:** Pure CSS3 with Flexbox.
-   **Unique IDs:** `uuid` library.
-   **Icons:** `react-icons` for modern, clean SVG icons.
-   **Persistence:** Browser `localStorage` API.
-   **Deployment:** Vercel
